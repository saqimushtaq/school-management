### **Core Modules & Features**

The TaleemTrack system will be composed of the following core modules, each designed to address a specific operational need of the school.

#### **Module 1: System Setup & Configuration**

This is the foundational module that will be configured once during the initial setup to define the school's structure.

*   **Academic Session Management:** The ability to create and manage academic years (e.g., 2024-2025, 2025-2026). All student data will be organized by session.
*   **Class & Section Creation:** The ability to define all classes in the school (e.g., Playgroup, Grade 1, O-Levels 1) and create multiple sections within each class (e.g., Class 5-A, Class 5-B).
*   **Subject Management:** A central place to add all subjects taught (e.g., Mathematics, Physics, Urdu) and assign them to the relevant classes.

#### **Module 2: Staff Management & Payroll**

This module manages all school employees, from teachers to administrative staff.

*   **Staff Directory:** A secure database to store profiles for all staff members, including their personal details, contact information, job title, and joining date.
*   **Teacher Assignment:** The ability to assign specific teachers to particular classes and subjects they are responsible for teaching.
*   **Basic Payroll:** A simple system to manage staff salaries. It will allow the administrator to generate monthly payslips for each employee, showing their basic salary and any deductions.

#### **Module 3: Student Information System (SIS)**

This is the heart of the system, managing every student's data from admission to graduation.

*   **Student Enrollment:** A form for the administrator to securely add a new student to the system once admission is confirmed. This will create a permanent digital record for the student.
*   **Student Profile:** A comprehensive profile page for each student, containing their personal information, family/guardian details, academic history, and photograph.
*   **Class Promotion:** A simple, one-click process at the end of an academic year to promote an entire class of students to the next grade.

#### **Module 4: Attendance Management**

This module automates the daily process of tracking student presence and communicating with parents.

*   **Teacher Attendance Portal:** A simple, fast interface for teachers to mark daily attendance for their assigned class as 'Present', 'Absent', or 'On Leave'.
*   **Automated Absentee Alerts:** When a teacher marks a student as absent, the system will automatically send an SMS to the student's registered parent/guardian, informing them immediately.

#### **Module 5: Fee Management & Accounting**

This module streamlines the entire fee cycle, from creation to collection.

*   **Fee Structure Definition:** The ability to create and manage different fee structures for various classes (e.g., Grade 5 Fee, Grade 10 Fee).
*   **Discount Management:** A flexible system to create and manage discounts (e.g., "Sibling Discount," "Staff Child Discount") and apply them to specific students' accounts.
*   **Automated Fee Voucher Generation:** The system will automatically generate a unique, professional PDF fee voucher for every student at the start of each month, including all applicable discounts.
*   **Payment Recording:** An interface for the accountant to mark fee vouchers as 'Paid' and record the payment method (Cash, Bank Transfer, or Online Payment).

#### **Module 6: Academics & Examinations**

This module handles all academic activities, from exams to report cards.

*   **Examination Setup:** The ability to create different examination periods (e.g., Mid-Term, Final Exams).
*   **Marks Entry:** A secure and simple interface for teachers to enter marks for the subjects they teach.
*   **Automated Report Card Generation:** The system will automatically calculate grades and totals, and generate professional, print-ready PDF report cards for any student or an entire class with a single click. The format will be based on the school's current design.

#### **Module 7: Communication Hub**

This module provides a centralized way for the school administration to communicate with parents.

*   **Bulk SMS Messaging:** An interface for the admin to compose and send text messages (SMS) to all parents, or to a targeted group (e.g., only parents of Class 10).
*   **Message History:** A log of all sent messages, including the content and the list of recipients.

#### **Module 8: User Access & Security**

This ensures that every user can only access the information relevant to their role.

*   **Role-Based Access:** The system will have different user roles (e.g., Principal, Teacher, Accountant, Parent) with specific permissions.
*   **Secure Login:** Each user will have their own unique username and password to securely log in to the system.
